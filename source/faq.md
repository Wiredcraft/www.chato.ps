## How does SweepBoard work?

SweepBoard is an online real-time collaborative Kanban that integrates the power of GitHub. Using SweepBoard, all of your repositories (that have an issue queue) are now also Kanban boards.

## Why do you need so much permissions from my GitHub account?

We are only asking for an access to your repository to populate the tickets list. We do not cache any information or share the access with any other platform.

## How do I collaborate with other contributors?

SweepBoard is a real-time web app, if you want to collaborate with others on it, just send them the URL for the board you're viewing and once they have authenticated they are on that board and you will see each others changes! Providing they have permissions to view that repository on GitHub.

## How much does it cost?

It will remain free while in beta and will remain free forever for public repositories.

## How do I filter issues?

So you have a lot of issues? Press Command or Control + F to open our filtering menu. Here you can filter issues by keyword, assignee, labels or milestone that issue has. Filtering allows you to select multiple fitlers and works on an "OR" basis, meaning if you select Bob and Steve for assignee, it will show you issues belonging to both Bob and Steve. Same goes for the labels, if you filter for the "bug" label and the "urgent" label, you will get all labels that have "bug", "urgent" or both.

## How do I manage lists?

In order to organise your Kanban board we use labels. You may select as many labels as you wish to organise your board by. For example you may have these 4 labels "Backlog", "Next", "WIP", "Done". If you select these labels (in the settings menu) your board will have 4 columns, 1 for each of these labels. Moving issue from column to column will swap these issues around so that an issue may only have 1 of these 4 at any given time. Other labels that are not being used to sort your board may still be used to filter issues further.

## What are unlisted issues?

Unlisted issues are issues that have none of the labels you are organising your board by. If we use the example we used for the previous question again, unlisted issues would be issues that do not have a "Backlog", "Next", "WIP" or "Done" label. However, they may have other labels that you are not organising your board by.

## How do I retrieve a closed issue?

Unfortunately at this time we are not displaying closed issues. To view or reopen a closed issue you will have to go to the GitHub issue queue. Adding a place for closed issues is in our roadmap.
