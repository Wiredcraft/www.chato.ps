### V1.0.1 - 2014.09.20

We've just released a new version of SweepBoard and we're pretty psyched. Not only did we cleaned up a lot of our backlog of issues, but we added the multi-repositories support. We have some more coming, but let me walk you through what we've just pushed online:

* **Multi repository support**: you can now create boards which can combine multiple GitHub repositories into a single Kanban board. This is particularly useful to manage large projects which often span over several repositories.
* **Realtime updates from GitHub**: if you update things on GitHub, the changes will now immediately appear on SweepBoard. This means your team can independently update and categorize issues with or without SweepBoard; your boards will always be up to date.
* **Wizard**: we added a wizard for new users to walk them through the main features of SweepBoard.
* **Pull request**: we are now styling pull requests differently from regular issues.
* **Github events**: we are now displaying GitHub events (label changes, assignments, etc) in the issues threads.
We've had a bit of fun with our [404 page](http://dev.sweepboard.com/404).

There are a lot more features coming in the next few weeks, including:

* **Milestone support**: allowing you to manage GitHub milestones from SweepBoard. This will integrate with the multi-repos support, allowing you to sync milestones across multiple repositories.
* **Analytics**: you will be able to access various metrics related to your projects; activity, cycle time, contributors stats, etc.
* **Stable enterprise version**: you'll be able to run SweepBoard on premises. Shoot us an email at [info+enteprise@sweepboard.com](mailto:info+enteprise@sweepboard.com) if you're interested in becoming a beta tester.
And much more.
