      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    </header>

    <section class='content'>
      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">Wiredcraft</a> we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we’ve decided to follow  the privacy policy of Automattic.com available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means we were welcome to steal it and repurpose it for our own use, just making sure we replaced references to them with ones from us, and as we appreciated it, here is a link to their awesome site <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic.com</a>. They spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same. We love Automattic.com for this.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>
<p>Wiredcraft Co. Ltd (“Wiredcraft”) operates several websites including <a href="http://chato.ps">ChatO.ps</a>. It is Wiredcraft’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>
<p> Like most website operators, Wiredcraft collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wiredcraft’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wiredcraft’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Wiredcraft may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p> Certain visitors to Wiredcraft’s websites choose to interact with Wiredcraft in ways that require Wiredcraft to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Wiredcraft gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, by purchasing access to the Business Intelligence, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In those cases, Wiredcraft collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Wiredcraft. Wiredcraft does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>
<p> Wiredcraft may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Wiredcraft may monitor the number of issues created through the repositories for internal monitoring. Wiredcraft does not and will never disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p> Wiredcraft discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Wiredcraft’s behalf or to provide services available at Wiredcraft’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Wiredcraft’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Wiredcraft will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Wiredcraft discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Wiredcraft believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Wiredcraft, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Wiredcraft website and have supplied your email address, Wiredcraft may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Wiredcraft and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Wiredcraft takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Wiredcraft uses cookies to help Wiredcraft identify and track visitors, their usage of Wiredcraft website, and their website access preferences. Wiredcraft visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Wiredcraft’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Wiredcraft’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
<p> If Wiredcraft, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Wiredcraft goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Wiredcraft may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
<p> Although most changes are likely to be minor, Wiredcraft may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Wiredcraft’s sole discretion. Wiredcraft encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
